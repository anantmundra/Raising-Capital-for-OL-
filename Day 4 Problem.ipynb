    "### The goal of a Dutch auction is the find the optimal price at which to sell a security.     \n",
    "### To participate in a Dutch auction, an investor typically opens an account with Company XYZ's underwriter (usually an investment bank), obtains a prospectus, and obtains an access code or bidder identification code (Dutch auctions often occur online).     \n",
    "### During bidding, investors indicate how many shares they're willing to buy and the price they're willing to pay. \n",
    "### The underwriter, who acts as the auctioneer, usually starts the auction by offering a prohibitively high price for the security. \n",
    "### When the auction closes, the underwriters calculate the highest price at which all shares will be sold.    "

    "### Normally, the price of shares in an IPO is set by an investment bank after conducting several valuation calculations and talking to potential investors. But a Dutch auction is theoretically more efficient at finding the \"right\" price that equates supply and demand.    \n",
    "### Buyers pay more for stock sold in Dutch auctions because under the traditional method investment banks typically underprice offerings to make sure all the shares sell.    \n",
    "### Shareholders benefit when shares are sold using traditional methods because the initial spike often associated with traditional IPOs creates an image of success that drives the stock even higher.    "
